LICENSE

Wbar is under GNU GPL license. Please, read the 'COPYING' to know what this means.

It'll be greatly appreciated if you mail the author (warlock) telling about any changes,
patches, recomendations, etc.

Thanks


Dependencies:
-------------
libimlib2-dev, intltool, pkg-config, libglade2-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, libx11-dev

General:
--------
wbar is a quick launch bar. Its fast, light and cool eye-candy.

Its hacked in c++ trying to keep code as readable as possible
with out sacrificing speed. It works directly on top of X to avoid
going throug a lot of layers.

Initially developed for Fluxbox, then tested on WindowMaker, Xfce, 
Gnome, etc.

Since version 1.0 can run on top of desktops such as xfdesktop 
or nautilus with the -above-desk switch.


Installing: (for the impacient)
-----------

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec_prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

or disable wbar-config

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --exec_prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --disable-wbar-config

$ make

As root
# make install

$ wbar -help (this gives you important options)

Now wbar should work out of the box(, but again ... may be not).

Notes:
------
* If you're getting window decorations (you shouldn't) when you start
  your window manager because you're using the -above-desk switch, 
  try to give the WM some time to start up before wbar does. 

  Example (in your startup script): (sleep 5s && wbar) &
  Note that the parenthesis surrounding the command are important.

Fonts:
------
Font support is new. Its used to display text below the icons.
To change font color / shadow / position you'll have
to hack into the code which shouldn't be dificult at all.
TODO: Fix wide labels, chopped when rendering as vertical bar.


Configuration file:
-------------------
If not supplied $HOME/.wbar will be tried, 
else /etc/default/wbar/wbar.cfg

.wbar format:
---------------
Commented lines start whith #.
Blank lines are ignored.

Example: 

Each icon has the following format:

i: <icon-file-path>
c: <command to execute on click>
t: <text to display on mouse over>

The order of appearance doesn't matter but all 3 of these lines must
appear. If you aren't gonna display text nor have a command associated
for a certain icon you should do the following:

i: <icon-file-path>
c: 
t: 


The first icon definition has a special meaning:
------------------------------------------------
i: <path-to-the-bar-background-image>
c: wbar --bpress --above-desk --vbar --pos right --isize 32 --idist 5 --nanim 4 --falfa 65
t: <path-to-font-to-display-text-with/size>

IF A FONT ISN'T SUPPLIED THEN NO TEXT RENDERING IS DONE.

*******************

Filters:
--------
-fc set the filter color which is applied to icons.
The format is 0xAARRGGBB

-filter controls where to apply filter 
0: dont apply 
1: apply to hovered icon 
2: apply to all but hovered 
3: all

experiment with other options.

BUGS:
----
Use the issue tracker :-)

Fix them man! I need a hand to keep this alive.
